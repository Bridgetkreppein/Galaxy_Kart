1.	Which game you chose and why you chose it
   
I chose the karting game because I am more familiar with the type of game play than an FPS game. I enjoy playing Mario Kart in my free time so I thought creating my own version would be fun.

3. Any challenges you encountered while working on the microgame
   
Overall, I did not find the assignment too challenging because the Learning Pathways gave me a lot of information that helped me through it. The microgame tutorial itself was simple and easy to follow. I only came across two problems whilst working on this assignment. The first was that unity kept freezing and would not register the steps correctly, so I had to redo the tutorial a few times. The second issue was that the window build was not showing the prefab assets that I had put in during the tutorial. I adjusted some settings and restarted the project and eventually it started to work.
